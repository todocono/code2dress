# code2dress

This is a workshop I designed inspired on the street artists that make T-shirts after drawing.

I fused both programming to draw (using blockly) and then continued the journey to transfer the designs onto cloths.

The results were quite amazing. More surprising than expected because the kids that participated actually expressed their interest in coding and experimented with different setups.
